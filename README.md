# KPMG-Virtual-Internship:
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months

In this internship, my task was to explore the preliminary data and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltdâ€™s data. I reviewed the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two and found out assumptions or issues we need to go back to the client on. As well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.
